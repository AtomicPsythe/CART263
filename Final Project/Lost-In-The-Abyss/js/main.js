/**
Final Project: Lost in the Abyss
Foti Aivaliklis

Lost in the Abyss is a fully developped version of my prototype submission for the game of the same name for the Game Engine Jam. 

Lost in the Abyss is a horror puzzle game where the player embarks on a journey to escape their trapped state within the Abyss Labyrinth
via comepleting a series of mazes each with unique gimmicks, including jumpscares, teleporation, collectible finding and more! In order to 
pass onto the next maze the previous one needs to be completed. With the help of the ambiance music, unique traps, and the setting, it provides
for an eerie experience for all players!

    // we set up the basic "arcade physics" engine with our game

    // Finally, the scene property has an array of the different scenes
    // in our game, with the one listed first being loaded automatically
    // Right now we don't have a scene to load, so let's leave it empty
    scene: [Boot, Title, IntroText, Maze1, Maze1Text, Maze2, Jumpscare, Maze2Text, Maze3, Maze3Text, End]
